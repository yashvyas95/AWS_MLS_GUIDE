# 🚀 AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty Certification Guide 2025! 🎓  

**AWS Machine Learning Specialty (MLS-C01)** exam! 🎉 This certification validates expertise in building, training, tuning, and deploying ML models on AWS—a critical skillset in today’s data-driven world.  

## 🔍 What the Exam Demands:  
The test is rigorous and focuses on:  
- **Data engineering** (storage, processing, feature engineering)  
- **Modeling** (algorithm selection, hyperparameter tuning)  
- **ML ops & deployment** (SageMaker, Lambda, containerization)  
- **AWS services** (SageMaker, Kinesis, Glue, Redshift ML, etc.)  
- **Cost optimization & security** (IAM, encryption, inference efficiency)  

## 📚 My Study Plan:  

## 💡 Key Takeaways:  
- Real-world ML on AWS is more than just SageMaker—it’s about integrating services like Glue, Athena, and Step Functions.  
- The exam tests **applied knowledge**, not just theory. Scenario-based questions dominate!  
- Time management is crucial; flag tough questions and revisit them.
